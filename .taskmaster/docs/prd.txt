Project: FluentFlow (Loora AI-level English Learning App)
Owner: USER1
Last Updated: 2025-08-12

0. Intent
- Build a production-quality app on par with Loora AI. No MVP shortcuts. Use Flutter + Firebase. Capture all visible product surfaces from provided assets and external research, including onboarding, home/daily lessons, practice drills, league, profile/achievements, settings, subscriptions, and real-time conversation with AI feedback.

1. Frameworks & Platforms
- Client: Flutter (stable LTS channel), Dart latest stable.
- Platforms: Android (primary), iOS (secondary, parity tracked), Web (PWA) optional after Android GA.
- State: Riverpod or Bloc (choose one; preference: Riverpod + Freezed for models).
- Theming: Material 3 + custom design tokens (see UI rules).
- Firebase SDKs: Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions, Remote Config, Crashlytics, Analytics, App Check, Cloud Messaging (notifications), In-App Messaging.
- Payments: Google Play Billing (via `in_app_purchase` or `purchases_flutter`), Apple IAP for iOS parity.

2. Architectural Approach
- Clean architecture with feature modules: `onboarding`, `home`, `lesson`, `practice`, `conversation`, `league`, `profile`, `settings`, `subscription`, `shared`.
- MVVM with Riverpod providers; immutable models (Freezed) and JSON serialization.
- Offline-first patterns: local cache using `hive` for small objects and on-disk media cache for lesson assets.
- Navigation: `go_router` with typed routes and deep-link support.
- Config: environment via Firebase Remote Config; secrets via App Check + Functions.

3. Database & Schema (Firebase)
- Auth users collection: uid, email, name, avatar, level, goals, createdAt, lastActive.
- Profiles: streaks, points, tiers, badges.
- Lessons: units > lessons > activities (types: speaking, pronunciation, grammar, vocab). Fields: prompts, correct answers, TTS hints, difficulty, tags.
- Attempts: per-user per-activity attempts with scores (pronunciation, grammar), timestamps, audio refs.
- Practice queue: recent mistakes surfaced from attempts.
- League: weekly seasons, tiers, user points, anti-cheat flags.
- Purchases: entitlement status, productId, platformReceipts, renewal info (mirrored from server validation).
- Settings: user prefs (tts voice, playback speed, notifications, privacy flags, locale).

4. Authentication
- Email/password, Google Sign-In. Optional Apple on iOS.
- Session persistence; re-auth for sensitive ops.
- Age gate when required; COPPA handling if under 13.

5. Payments / Monetization
- Products: Monthly, Annual, Lifetime (optional). Intro offers, free trial.
- Server-side receipt validation via Cloud Functions. Entitlement doc updated on verified purchase.
- Paywall: shown on gating events (starting conversation after N free uses, end-of-lesson, accessing premium drills). Restore purchases in settings.

5a. Premium vs Free Plan (derived from assets + Loora-style benchmarks)
- Free tier
  - 1 Daily Lesson per day (basic steps only)
  - Limited AI conversations (e.g., 1 session/day or 5 minutes/day) with basic text feedback
  - Basic practice drills; limited review (recent items only)
  - Entry league tier only
  - No offline downloads; single default coach voice
- Premium tier
  - Unlimited Daily Lessons and Practice packs (speaking, pronunciation, grammar, vocab)
  - Unlimited AI voice conversations with advanced feedback (phoneme-level pronunciation, grammar explanations)
  - Personalized learning plan and goal-based paths
  - Review hub with complete attempt history + auto-generated re-drills
  - Coach options: multiple voices/accents/personas
  - Offline lessons and cached TTS
  - Full League access (higher tiers, rewards), premium badges
  - Streak protection (freeze/restore)
  - Level/course certificates
  - Priority support
- SKUs & trials: Monthly, Annual (discounted), optional Lifetime; 7‑day trial + intro pricing
- Gating moments: after the free Daily Lesson, after free conversation allowance is exceeded, when opening advanced packs, entering higher league tiers, choosing coach personas, enabling offline mode

6. Security & Privacy
- App Check enabled; Firestore rules per-user; Storage rules for user-owned recordings.
- PII minimization; data export/delete endpoints; retention policy for audio (default 90 days, configurable).
- Network: HTTPS strictly; secure webhooks for Play billing notifications.

7. APIs & Integrations
- Speech-to-Text (STT): Google Cloud Speech-to-Text streaming API (Functions proxy; client uses gRPC/websocket to Functions).
- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Google Cloud TTS voices; cache generated audio in Storage.
- AI Feedback: grammar/pronunciation scoring pipeline via Functions (can integrate 3rd-party pronunciation SDK if needed).
- Notifications: FCM for streaks, lesson reminders, league results.

8. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for providers and domain logic.
- Golden tests for widgets (key screens).
- Integration tests with `flutter_test` + `integration_test` for auth, onboarding, lesson flow, purchase.
- Staging environment with emulators (Auth, Firestore, Functions) for CI.

9. Deployment & CI/CD
- CI: GitHub Actions workflows for lint/test/build; cache pub deps.
- Release: EAS-equivalent via Fastlane or Codemagic (Android App Bundle). Internal → Closed → Production tracks.
- Crashlytics + Analytics auto-upload in release builds.

10. User Onboarding Experience (from assets: `onboarding1`)
- Steps: intro → account → goals → level → notifications → home.
- Requirements: progress indicator, back/resume, validation, analytics per-step.

11. Home & Daily Lessons (from assets: `home.dailylesson2`)
- Home shows progress ring, lesson categories (Reading, Listening, Speaking, Grammar), streak CTA.
- Daily Lesson flow with sub-steps: speaking prompts, pronunciation drill, grammar translate-with-tiles, end summary.

12. Conversation (coach) Experience
- Real-time session with waveform, mic control, captions, turn-taking.
- Live feedback overlays; post-session review cards stored to attempts.
- Latency budget: < 400 ms per turn; prefetch TTS audio.

13. Practice Tab (from assets: `practiceTab3`)
- Skill tiles; drills sourced from mistakes and configured sets; quick scoring.

14. League (from assets: `Leaguse4`)
- Weekly tiers; points from lessons/practice; reset cadence; anti-cheat heuristics.

15. Profile, Achievements, Settings (from assets: `WilliamUsername5`)
- Profile summary, badges with unlock criteria.
- Settings inventory: notifications, speech options, privacy/export, language, restore purchases, account deletion.

16. Data Migration & Portability
- Export user data (JSON + media links) on request; delete flow with grace period.
- Versioned Firestore docs; migration scripts in Functions.

17. Error Handling & User Feedback
- Standard error surfaces: snackbars/toasts, inline field errors, retry actions, offline banners.
- Global handler for uncaught exceptions (Crashlytics) with user-visible fallback screen.

18. Performance Monitoring & Analytics
- Firebase Performance traces around conversation, lesson steps, purchases.
- Core events: onboarding_step, lesson_start/step/complete, practice_start/complete, conversation_start/end, purchase_*.

19. Regulatory Compliance
- GDPR/CCPA support (export/delete); terms/privacy screens; COPPA if applicable.
- Recording consent prompts; storage regions.

20. App Store Guidelines
- Google Play target SDK current, background mic usage policy compliance, subscriptions disclosures, refund flows.

21. Localization & Internationalization
- App strings via Flutter Intl; right-to-left support; locale switch in settings.
- Content locale separation in Firestore; TTS/STT voice selection by locale.

22. Accessibility & Design Quality
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA; semantic widgets; large tap targets; captions.
- UI must follow project rules: see `.cursor/rules/ui_professional.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/cursor_ui_enhancement.mdc`.

23. Risks & Mitigations
- Latency: edge caching, prefetch; choose closest region; partial on-device inference later.
- Cost: stream STT/TTS, compress audio, cap session length; Remote Config limits.
- Abuse: rate limiting, league anti-cheat, moderated user-generated prompts.

24. Open Questions
- Final paywall copy and gating rules; SKUs & pricing.
- Final vendor choice for pronunciation scoring (if external SDK preferred).
- Coach personalities and accents scope at launch.

25. IP Compliance & Differentiation (Non-infringing Policy)
- Do not reuse Loora branding, logos, illustrations, proprietary copy, or distinctive layouts.
- Follow common UX patterns only; implement our own layout grid, icon set, and wording.
- Generate original lesson prompts, conversation lines, and grammar examples.
- Replace all research screenshots/videos with our own assets during build; these assets are for analysis only.
- Maintain a design-differentiation checklist per screen (palette, spacing, component shapes) to ensure distinct look.
- Keep provenance notes for content creation; store in `docs/content-provenance/`.
