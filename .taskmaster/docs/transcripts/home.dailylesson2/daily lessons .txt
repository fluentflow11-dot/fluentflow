I'm sorry to hear that you're not enjoying your time in Ireland. The weather can definitely be gloomy, but have you tried any local dishes or activities that you found interesting? That sounds frustrating. While curry chips and hamburgers can be nice, Ireland has some fantastic traditional dishes like stew or soda bread. I understand that cultural differences can influence food choices. Ireland is rich in history and traditions, and there are plenty of other options to explore.
