I appreciate your honesty. Ireland is known for its lively music scenes, stunning landscapes and festivals like St Patrick's Day. Exploring local pubs or music events could be a fun way to experience the culture. Have you considered checking any of those out? That sounds amazing! The St Patrick's Day parade is such a vibrant celebration. Did you enjoy the music and the atmosphere? That sounds intense! While the atmosphere can be lively, it's unfortunate that it escalated into a fight. Did you manage to enjoy any of the performances or other activities during the parade? Oh my goodness, that sounds like a shocking experience! I hope everyone was okay in the end. Did you get a chance to see any other parades or events that were more enjoyable?
