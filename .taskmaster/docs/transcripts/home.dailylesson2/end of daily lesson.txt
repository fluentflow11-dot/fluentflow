That sounds like a wild adventure! Hunting leprechauns must have been quite the unique experience. Did you come across any interesting tales or traditions during your hunt? That sounds like quite the entertaining encounter. It was great getting to know you and I can't wait to chat again tomorrow morning for your first Daily Word. It's sure to be fun!
