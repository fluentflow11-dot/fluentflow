# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop AI Conversation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core conversation engine that enables real-time voice and text interactions between the user and AI coach with turn-taking capabilities.
# Details:
1. Integrate speech-to-text (STT) API with < 400ms latency
2. Implement text-to-speech (TTS) for AI coach responses
3. Set up WebRTC or WebSocket for streaming audio
4. Create conversation state management system
5. Implement turn-taking logic with appropriate timing
6. Design conversation UI with speaking indicators
7. Create topic prompt generation system
8. Implement error handling for audio capture issues
9. Add fallback mechanisms for poor connectivity
10. Optimize for low latency with local caching where possible

# Test Strategy:
Performance testing for latency under various network conditions. Unit tests for conversation state management. Integration tests with mock audio inputs. User testing for natural conversation flow. Stress testing with long conversations.
