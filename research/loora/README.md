# Loora AI Reference Assets

Place screenshots and short screen recordings here to inform the PRD.

Recommended naming:
- screenshots: `loora-YYYYMMDD-01.png`, `loora-YYYYMMDD-02.png`, ...
- videos: `loora-YYYYMMDD-01.mp4` (keep each under ~30–60s if possible)

For each asset, add a brief note (what screen, what flow, any key text):

Example note format:
```
file: loora-20250812-01.png
context: Onboarding – choose goal and level
observations: 3 goals, 5 levels, CTA continues at bottom
```

You can also paste notes directly into `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` under "Appendix A. Asset Notes" with the same format.
